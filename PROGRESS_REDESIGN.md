## 📁 Architecture Updates

### New Folder Structure
```
src/components/
├── sections/           # ✅ NEW - Main page sections
│   ├── HeroSection.tsx
│   ├── AboutSection.tsx
│   ├── ProjectsSection.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── 3d/                 # ✅ NEW - Three.js components
│   ├── ParticleField.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── ui/                 # ✅ EXISTING - Reusable UI components

```

### Following design.md Architecture ✅
- ✅ Sections organized in dedicated folder
- ✅ 3D components isolated for lazy loading
- ✅ Reusable UI components properly structured
- ✅ Clean exports via index.ts files

## 🎨 Design System Integration

All new sections use the existing design system:
- **Colors:** Holographic gradients (cyan, magenta, violet, gold), terminal green/blue
- **Effects:** Glass morphism, CRT/scanlines, gradient orbs, hover glows
- **Typography:** Font hierarchy with holographic text for headlines
- **Animations:** Framer Motion with layout transitions, stagger effects
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first with breakpoints (md, lg)

   - Run `npm run dev` and test in browser
   - Check animations, responsiveness, interactions

2. **Continue with Remaining Sections** 🚀
   - Terminal Section (enhance existing)
   - Contact Section (highest priority for user engagement)
   - Music Section (creative feature)
   - CTF Section (easter egg / fun feature)

3. **Performance Optimization** ⚡
   - Lazy load heavy components (3D, music player)
   - Image optimization (WebP, responsive images)
   - Bundle analysis (`npm run build:analyze`)
   - Code splitting

4. **Accessibility & Testing** ♿

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Static Export Mode
- **Decision:** Disabled R3F ParticleField in Hero due to static export limitations
- **Solution:** Static gradient background with CRT effects as fallback
- **Impact:** Better build reliability, still visually impressive

### Design System First
- **Decision:** Reuse existing design-system.css and theme.ts
- **Benefit:** Consistent visual language, faster development

### Progressive Enhancement
- **Decision:** Build section by section, test incrementally
- **Benefit:** Lower risk, easier debugging, immediate feedback
