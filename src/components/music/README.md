# Music Section Implementation

## Overview
The Music Section provides an immersive audio experience with a glassmorphic player, real-time visualizer, and playlist management. Music playback persists across page navigation.

## Components

### 1. MusicSection (`src/components/MusicSection.tsx`)
Main container component that orchestrates the music experience.
- Displays the audio visualizer and player side-by-side
- Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)
- Animated entrance effects

### 2. MusicPlayer (`src/components/MusicPlayer.tsx`)
Full-featured audio player with glassmorphism styling.

**Features:**
- Play/pause control
- Next/previous track navigation
- Seekable progress bar with time display
- Volume slider with mute toggle
- Holographic gradient styling
- Smooth micro-animations

### 3. PlaylistSelector (`src/components/PlaylistSelector.tsx`)
Interactive playlist and track selection interface.

**Features:**
- Three preset playlists:
  - City Pop Mix (Synthwave Dreams)
  - Jazz Fusion Tokyo 1986 (Jazz Fusion Loop)
  - 90s Boom Bap Focus Mode (Hip Hop Loop)
- Animated playlist tabs with active indicator
- Track list with current track highlighting
- Playing indicator animation (animated bars)
- Smooth transitions between playlists

### 4. AudioVisualizer (`src/components/AudioVisualizer.tsx`)
Real-time circular audio visualizer using Web Audio API.

**Features:**
- Canvas-based rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- 64 frequency bars arranged in a circle
- Holographic gradient colors based on position
- Glow effects for high frequencies
- Glass effect center circle that pulses with audio
- Responsive to window resize
- Placeholder state when not playing

## State Management

### MusicContext (`src/contexts/MusicContext.tsx`)
Global React Context for music player state.

**Provides:**
- Current playlist and track selection
- Playback state (playing, paused)
- Volume and mute controls
- Current time and duration
- AnalyserNode for visualizations
- Actions: play/pause, next/previous, seek, volume control

**Persistence:**
- Saves state to localStorage
- Restores playlist, track, volume, and mute state on reload
- Music continues playing across page navigation

## Audio Infrastructure

### Audio Library (`src/lib/audio.ts`)
Core audio data structures and playback logic.

**Exports:**
- `Track` interface: Track metadata (id, title, artist, url, duration)
- `Playlist` interface: Playlist with tracks
- `playlists` array: Three preset playlists
- `AudioManager` class: Handles HTML5 Audio and Web Audio API
  - Audio playback control
  - Web Audio API AnalyserNode setup
  - Event handling (play, pause, ended, timeupdate)
  - Volume control and seeking

**Audio Files:**
Uses existing files from `public/assets/music/`:
- `synthwave-loop.mp3`
- `jazz-fusion-loop.mp3`
- `hip-hop-loop.mp3`

## Usage

### Basic Setup
The MusicProvider is already added to the root layout:

```tsx
// src/app/layout.tsx
import { MusicProvider } from "@/contexts/MusicContext";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <MusicProvider>
          {children}
        </MusicProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Using the Music Section
```tsx
import MusicSection from '@/components/MusicSection';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main>
      <MusicSection />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Accessing Music State Anywhere
```tsx
import { useMusic } from '@/contexts/MusicContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isPlaying, currentTrack, playPause } = useMusic();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {isPlaying && <p>Now playing: {currentTrack?.title}</p>}
      <button onClick={playPause}>Toggle</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Technical Details

### Web Audio API Integration
- Uses AnalyserNode for frequency data
- FFT size: 256 (provides 128 frequency bins)
- Visualizer samples 64 frequency bins
- Updates at 60fps using requestAnimationFrame

### Performance Optimizations
- Canvas rendering with device pixel ratio support
- Efficient frequency data sampling
- Cleanup on component unmount
- Conditional rendering (visualizer only when playing)

### Accessibility
- Keyboard-accessible controls
- ARIA labels on buttons
- Visual feedback for all interactions
- Respects reduced motion preferences (via Framer Motion)

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **5.1** - Minimalist audio player with glassmorphism styling  
✅ **5.2** - Three playlists: City Pop, Jazz Fusion, 90s Boom Bap  
✅ **5.3** - Subtle audio visualizer with circular glass effects  
✅ **5.4** - Play/pause, track selection, volume slider, mute toggle  
✅ **5.5** - Smooth micro-interactions on controls  
✅ **5.6** - Web Audio API for high-quality playback  
✅ **5.7** - No autoplay on page load (user must initiate)  
✅ **5.8** - Persist playback state across navigation  
✅ **5.9** - Visualizer synchronized with audio frequency data  

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add more tracks to each playlist
- Implement shuffle and repeat modes
- Add keyboard shortcuts (space for play/pause, arrow keys for seek)
- Implement audio crossfade between tracks
- Add equalizer controls
- Support for user-uploaded playlists
- Integration with Spotify/SoundCloud API
