# üöÄ Deployment Guide - Khalid's Portfolio

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the portfolio to Netlify and other hosting platforms.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- ‚úÖ Completed development and testing
- ‚úÖ Git repository with your code
- ‚úÖ GitHub/GitLab account for repository hosting
- ‚úÖ Netlify account (free tier available)
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key (optional, for chatbot functionality)

## üåê Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

```bash
# Ensure your code is in a Git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete portfolio with easter eggs"

# Push to GitHub/GitLab
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/khalid-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Netlify

1. **Sign in to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up or log in with GitHub/GitLab

2. **Import Repository**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab)
   - Select the `khalid-portfolio` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: out
   ```

4. **Advanced Settings** (if needed)
   - Node version: `18` or higher
   - Environment: Production

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add the following variables:

   ```
   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_KEY
   Value: sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

   > **Note**: If you don't have an OpenAI key, skip this step. The chatbot will use mock responses automatically.

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Trigger Deployment**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

2. **Monitor Build**
   - Check build logs for any errors
   - Common issues and solutions below

3. **Test Live Site**
   - Visit your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://amazing-portfolio-123456.netlify.app`)
   - Test all features:
     - [ ] Homepage loads with 3D scene
     - [ ] Terminal functions work
     - [ ] Easter eggs activate properly
     - [ ] Music player operates
     - [ ] Projects page displays
     - [ ] Chatbot responds

### Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **Purchase Domain** (if needed)
   - Any domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)

2. **Configure in Netlify**
   - Site Settings ‚Üí Domain Management
   - Add custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

3. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Automatically provided by Netlify
   - Force HTTPS redirect recommended

## üîß Alternative Deployment Options

### Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts for configuration
```

**Vercel Configuration:**
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Output Directory: `out`
- Framework: `Next.js`

### GitHub Pages Deployment

```bash
# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d out"

# Deploy
npm run deploy
```

### AWS S3 + CloudFront

```bash
# Build site
npm run build

# Upload `out/` folder to S3 bucket
# Configure CloudFront distribution
# Set up custom domain with Route 53
```

### Self-Hosted (VPS/Server)

```bash
# Build site
npm run build

# Upload `out/` folder to web server
# Configure Nginx/Apache to serve static files
# Set up SSL certificate
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures

**Error: "Module not found"**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Error: "TypeScript errors"**
- Check `tsconfig.json` configuration
- Fix any type errors in the code
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Error: "Three.js WebGL errors"**
- Usually resolved in production build
- Check browser WebGL support
- Verify Three.js imports are correct

### Runtime Issues

**3D Scene Not Loading**
```javascript
// Check WebGL support
if (!window.WebGLRenderingContext) {
  console.log('WebGL not supported');
}
```

**Audio Not Playing**
- Browser autoplay policies
- Ensure audio files exist (they're placeholders by default)
- Check console for audio context errors

**Easter Eggs Not Working**
- Verify JavaScript is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Test event listeners are properly attached

### Performance Issues

**Slow Loading**
- Enable gzip compression
- Optimize images (WebP format)
- Consider lazy loading for heavy assets

**Mobile Performance**
- Test on actual devices
- Use Chrome DevTools mobile simulation
- Monitor Core Web Vitals
